## üîé About Me

I'm **Umar Javaid**, a BS Software Engineering student at Virtual University of Pakistan with a strong interest in **cybersecurity** and penetration testing. I build web projects using modern JavaScript frameworks and practice security on CTFs and labs to level up my offensive and defensive skills.

I enjoy learning new languages, improving my problem-solving, and building tools that are clean, secure, and maintainable.
